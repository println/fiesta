# Phone user stories

The phone side of the app, as the user stated it. Ids are `PH-<n>` and follow the order the
stories were given, so `PH-6` is always the same story wherever it is cited. Each story carries
what already works today, which is the detail the app must not lose.

## Not met yet

- **PH-6** — the desktop-mode icon in the address bar. The feature itself works and is shared
  with the car; only the indicator is missing.
- **PH-15** — the master switch. The global blocking switch is only a default for untouched
  sites today; it neither overrides nor freezes the per-site choices.
- **PH-18** — not verified. Nobody has checked ordinary browsing against it.
- **PH-19** — wanted for the future; nothing of it exists.
- **PH-20** — the donate button still opens Ko-fi; it should open the donate page in the default
  browser, in the phone's language.

## Shared with the car

Tracker/ad blocking per site (PH-5), desktop mode per site (PH-6) and bookmarks (PH-7) are one
set of data, not a phone copy: what the phone changes is what the car reads.
