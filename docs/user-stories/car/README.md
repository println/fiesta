## Not met yet

- **CR-1** — there, with problems not yet pinned down one by one.
- **CR-2** — on shorts the plugin handles only the short presses, so there is no long-press
  seek there. A channel does get opened by voice search: nothing rules one out today.
- **CR-3** — ads are only skipped while tracker/ad blocking is on for the site.
- **CR-4** — unmuting only acts on `/watch`, so a short that starts muted stays muted.
- **CR-5 and CR-6** — not verified on the car.
- **CR-17** — the structure is there, the installer is not: an engine is already data, but it
  can only be read from the APK, and its name and icon are still bound to a known id.
- **CR-19** — not tried on a car with the steering wheel on the right.
- **CR-20** — not built yet.

CR-7 to CR-16 and CR-18 are all there and doing what the user wants.
